# Picostat V2
 This is the codebase for the Picostat build from the "Another Smart Thermostat" video.


I have included the necessary Adafruit libraries in this code base, but if you want to install them yourself, just take the three files in the root directory. The main.py file is commented with the settings you'll need to fill in. The code here requires MicroPython, so please be aware of that.
